Description: control IEEE 1394 audio/video devices (development files)
 libavc1394 is a programming interface for the 1394 Trade Association AV/C
 (Audio/Video Control) Digital Interface Command Set. It allows you to
 remote control camcorders and similar devices connected to your computer
 via an IEEE 1394 (aka Firewire) link.
 .
 This package includes the libraries and header files needed to compile
 programs using libavc1394, as well as the command line tool dvcont that
 acts as a simple remote control, the tool mkrfc2734 that is needed
 to advertise IP over IEEE 1394 (RFC 2734) capabilities with the Linux
 2.4 kernel series, and the utility panelctl, a remote control for
 set-top boxes.
